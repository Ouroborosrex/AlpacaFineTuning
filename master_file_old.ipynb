      "The fraction 4/16 is equivalent to 1/4 because both fractions represent the same value. A fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by a common factor. In this case, 4 is a common factor of both the numerator and the denominator of 4/16. When we divide both by 4, we get 4/4 = 1 and 16/4 = 4, so the simplified fraction is 1/4. Alternatively, we can think of this in terms of multiplication. For example, if we multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction 1/4 by 4, we get (1x4)/(4x4), or 4/16. Since both fractions can be derived from the other through multiplication or division by the same number, they represent the same value and are equivalent.</s> \n",

      "\n",
      "4. Bank Failures - As demand for goods declined, many banks began to fail, causing a loss of confidence in the banking system. This led to a massive withdrawal of money from banks, causing even more banks to fail.\n",
